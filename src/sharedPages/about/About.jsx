        “tasty cookes compass” was founded in 2023 by Natttachai Changrattanachaichok
        (known more commonly as Chang). It began humbly enough in Napier as a
        weekend food business – ran out of a caravan. Regularly attending the
        local markets, Chang started to gather a loyal following. Chang decided
        to take this success a step further into full-time work. Chang’s caravan
        took up regular residence serving delicious Thai food outside his house
        on Kennedy Road in 2000. Thai Chef Restaurant now has branches all
        across New Zealand – Wellington, Auckland (Parnell Auckland and
        Titirangi Auckland), Napier, Whangarei, Christchurch and New Plymouth.
        We have takeaway options, lunch menu options, dinner menu options and
        even delivery options within some of our locations. Below are images of
        our chefs at work – ensuring they deliver the best Thai Food.
